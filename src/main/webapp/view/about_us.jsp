            <h1>About Tea Trade AI</h1>
            <p>Revolutionizing Sri Lanka's tea industry through smart technology, connecting farmers directly with buyers, and creating a transparent, efficient marketplace for Ceylon tea.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
            <p>Tea Trade AI emerged from a deep understanding of Sri Lanka's tea industry challenges and the potential of artificial intelligence to transform traditional trading practices. Sri Lanka's tea industry, valued at over $1.2 billion annually, has long been the backbone of our economy, involving hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers, estate workers, brokers, and exporters.</p>
            
            <p>Despite its global significance, the tea trade process has remained heavily reliant on outdated manual systems and intermediary brokers, creating inefficiencies that particularly impact small-scale farmers in rural areas. These farmers often lack direct access to competitive markets, limiting their income potential and business autonomy.</p>
